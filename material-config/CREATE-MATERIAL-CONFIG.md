Purpose
-------

miluphcuda supports multiple materials, and multiple rheologies. Many important settings for
the material model, especially material parameters, are parsed in a structured config file,
typically named *material.cfg*. In addition to material parameters, some numerical settings
(e.g., for the smoothing length) are also configured via that file.

The config file is processed by the *libconfig* library.
Check http://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/ for the latest version and documentation.

**Note**: This file is one of three places where you configure miluphcuda settings. The other two are:

* *parameter.h* (at compile time)
* *cmd-line flags*

The config file is passed to miluphcuda by the `-m` cmd-line option.

----------------------------------------------------------------


File structure
--------------

The config file consists of key-value pairs, organized in groups for different materials,
equation of state, etc. Groups are blocks enclosed in `{...}`.

The group *global* contains settings affecting all materials.
Settings for individual materials are organized in the list *materials*.

The basic file structure, containing *n* different materials, looks like:

        global = {
            ...
        }

        materials =
        (
            {
                ID = 0
                name = ...
                ...

                eos = {
                    type = ...
                    ...
                    ...
                }
            },
            {
                ID = 1
                name = ...
                ...

                eos = {
                    type = ...
                    ...
                    ...
                }
            },
            .
            .
            .
            {
                ID = n-1
                name = ...
                ...

                eos = {
                    type = ...
                    ...
                    ...
                }
            }
        );

The available/required settings depend on the used material model(s), and are listed and described below.

Config files can be conveniently assembled by including external content using:

        @include "<file>"

Include directives can also be nested.

The `material.cfg` file in this directory contains an example setup, comprising several materials and material models.

Note that, for now, the `eos = {...}` group regularly contains not only equation-of-state-specific entries,
but also further parameters related to the material model.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Where to find material parameters?
----------------------------------

* The `material_data/` directory contains parameters for various materials.

* You can also check the `test_cases/` and `examples/` directories for various material setups.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Good to know...
---------------

* The entries in the config file have to match their data type. For example, the ID tag has to be
  an integer value whereas the value for the cohesion has to be given in floating point notation:

        cohesion = 1000

  will not work but

        cohesion = 1000.0   or   cohesion = 1.0e3

  are valid entries. The libconfig specs indicate that a period is *always* mandatory for floats...

* The code prints out all read material parameters if the verbose flag `-v` is used.

* If values are ommitted, default values are assumed (see below). In most cases, these default values are not what you want.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Global settings
---------------

The group *global* (see file structure above) contains options affecting all materials:

        Key         Type    Default         Details
        ___________________________________________

        c_gravity   float   6.67408e-11     grav. constant, determining code units (default is SI),
                                            check material_data/grav-const.cfg for some options

----------------------------------------------------------------


Individual material settings
----------------------------

Here, all settings for individual materials are described, ordered mainly by material model and/or
equation of state. For the keys in the following lists, the top level is assumed to be a specific material
and subgroups within materials are denoted by dot syntax. For example, *ID* is on the top level of some material,
and *eos.type* is the key *type* in the subgroup *eos*. (See above for the overall file structure.)

All units are SI, unless noted otherwise.

This list is currently not exhaustive.


**Always mandatory**

        Key         Type    Default     Details
        _______________________________________

        ID          int     none        material ID, has to fit SPH particles' material-type
                                        in input file, IDs have to be 0, 1, 2,...

        eos.type    int     none        set equation of state for material, for a complete list see
                                        https://christophmschaefer.github.io/miluphcuda/pressure_8h.html
                                        or look directly into pressure.h

--------------------------------

**Always optional**

        Key             Type    Default                             Details
        ___________________________________________________________________

        name            str     none                                name of material, currently not
                                                                    processed by miluphcuda

        density_floor   float   1% of bulk/reference density, or    minimum density (absolute value)
                                1% of matrix if porous, or          allowed for material
                                0. for gases

        energy_floor    float   none                                minimum energy (absolute value)

--------------------------------

**Elastic constants**

Which elastic constants are required depends on the used material model and equation of state.
The shear modulus is always required for solid simulations (`SOLID` is set in parameter.h).
The bulk modulus may be required for sound speed estimates, the Grady-Kipp fragmentation model, etc.

        Key                 Type    Default
        ___________________________________

        eos.bulk_modulus    float   0.
        eos.shear_modulus   float   0.

Note: The other two elastic constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) are computed from them as needed.

--------------------------------

**EoS: Murnaghan**

To use the Murnaghan EoS for some material, set

        eos.type = 1

and the following parameters:

        Key                 Type    Default             Details
        _______________________________________________________

        eos.rho_0           float   0.                  reference density
        eos.bulk_modulus    float   0.
        eos.n               float   1.

        eos.rho_limit       float   0.9                 for rho/rho_0 < rho_limit the pressure is set
                                                        to zero; intended to avoid unphysically high
                                                        negative pressures where the material would
                                                        actually fragment or form droplets

Note: For n=1 the Murnaghan EoS reduces to the simple *liquid EoS*.

--------------------------------

**EoS: Tillotson**

To use the Tillotson EoS for some material, set

        eos.type = 2

and the following parameters:

        Key                 Type    Default             Details
        _______________________________________________________

        eos.till_rho_0      float   0.                  reference density

        eos.till_alpha      float   0.
        eos.till_beta       float   0.

        eos.rho_limit       float   0.9                 for cold (i.e., if e < till_E_cv) expanded states
                                                        with rho/rho_0 < rho_limit the pressure is set to
                                                        zero; intended to avoid unphysically high negative
                                                        pressures where the material would actually
                                                        fragment or form droplets

        eos.cs_limit        float   1% of approx.       lower limit for sound speed (in m/s), default
                                    bulk sound speed    is 1% of sqrt(till_A/till_rho_0); can be used
                                                        to avoid unphysical values, like imaginary sound
                                                        speeds for negative pressures

**Plasticity model: von Mises**

The von Mises model constitutes a single, constant yield strength.

You need to set `VON_MISES_PLASTICITY` in parameter.h (at compile time), and in the material config file:

        Key                 Type    Default
        ___________________________________

        eos.yield_stress    float   0.

--------------------------------

**Plasticity model: Collins**

The Collins model is based on a pressure-dependent yield strength, which also depends on whether
the material is intact or fragmented (*damaged*). See comments in parameter.h for more details.

You need to set `COLLINS_PLASTICITY` in parameter.h (at compile time), and in the material config file:

        Key                             Type    Default     Details

--------------------------------

**Plasticity model: Collins simple**

This is a simplified version of the Collins model. See comments in parameter.h for more details.

You need to set `COLLINS_PLASTICITY_SIMPLE` in parameter.h (at compile time), and in the material config file:

        Key                     Type    Default     Details
        ___________________________________________________

        eos.cohesion            float   0.

        eos.yield_stress        float   0.

--------------------------------

**Plasticity model: Drucker-Prager**

This is a linear dependence of the yield strength on pressure.

You need to set `DRUCKER_PRAGER_PLASTICITY` in parameter.h (at compile time), and in the material config file:

        Key                     Type    Default     Details
        ___________________________________________________
        
        eos.cohesion            float   0.
        eos.friction_angle      float   0.          in rad

        eos.yield_stress        float   0.          optional upper limit for the yield strength,
                                                    where you have to additionally set
                                                    VON_MISES_PLASTICITY in parameter.h for this

--------------------------------

**Plasticity model: Mohr-Coulomb**

This is a linear dependence of the yield strength on pressure.

You need to set `MOHR_COULOMB_PLASTICITY` in parameter.h (at compile time), and in the material config file:

        Key                     Type    Default     Details
        ___________________________________________________

        eos.cohesion            float   0.
        eos.friction_angle      float   0.          in rad

        eos.yield_stress        float   0.          optional upper limit for the yield strength,
                                                    where you have to additionally set
                                                    VON_MISES_PLASTICITY in parameter.h for this

--------------------------------

**Fragmentation model: Grady-Kipp**

To activate the full Grady-Kipp model set `FRAGMENTATION` and `DAMAGE_ACTS_ON_S` in parameter.h (at compile time).
This is currently only possible globally for all materials at once.
Whether you want `DAMAGE_ACTS_ON_S` depends mainly on the desired interaction with the plasticity model (see comments in parameter.h).

The following parameters are currently only needed for some pre-processing tools.

        Key                         Type    Default     Details

        fragmentation.weibull_m     float   none        not processed by miluphcuda

--------------------------------

**Porosity model: P-alpha**

The P-alpha porosity model can be used together with several EoS, which all have a distinct *eos.type*
when used together with the P-alpha model:

* *eos.type = 5* ... P-alpha + Tillotson EoS
* *eos.type = 6* ... P-alpha + Murnaghan EoS
* *eos.type = 13* ... P-alpha + ANEOS

In addition to the parameters for the respective EoS, you need the following:
