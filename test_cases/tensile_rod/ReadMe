2D tensile rod test case, for plasticity and fragmentation/damage models.
The test case is set up in dimensionless units.
See Gray (2001) and Schäfer (2005) for details.
See also Schäfer et al. (2016), Sect. 4.1 for the used units.

A constant velocity (5e-3) for slices of particles pulls the rod apart. These boundary conditions
are implemented directly in boundary.cu. In addition, a transition zone without flaws ensures
that the elastic wave generated by the boundary conditions is transmitted correctly.

Particles are placed on a squared grid, the resolution can be set via the grid
spacing (see input/create_2D_rod.py -h). Don't forget to adapt the sml in material.cfg.

The Weibull parameters represent a basalt-like material, see Schäfer (2005).


How to run it:

(i)   run input/create_2D_rod.py to create initial conditions (no flags necessary for default settings)
      copy input/rod.0000 to this directory
(ii)  compile miluphcuda with src/boundary.cu and src/parameter.h
(iii) execute run.sh
(iv)  wait
(v)   run mk_animation.sh to visualize the results

The simulation typically runs for few minutes and produces 250 output files (8 MB each).
