# Dam break simulation simu

This is just a quick test to setup a dam break like simulation.
It uses simple boundary particles to model the wall and the floor. Additionally, the material parameters
for water have to be changed accordingly in <tt>material.cfg</tt>.

Handle with care, this requires still some tweaking if you want to compare the results to other dambreak models.

To see the output, use the plot.py script.
