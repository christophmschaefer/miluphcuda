# Colliding ring test case

Two 2D colliding rings, example taken from Monaghan SPH without a tensile instability, JCP 2000

To run the example:
  i execute generate_initial_rings.py
  ii compile miluphcuda with the parameter.h file from the test_cases/colliding_rings directory
  iii run run.sh

The code generates output files rings.0001 to rings.0500 (and .h5 if you have turned on hdf5 support).

The runtime of the simulation is 2 min on a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Ti.


The small plot script plot.py can be used to generate a density colourcoded plot of the sph particles.
