//   (3) Mohr-Coulomb (MC) yield criterion

//       Note: For DP and MC you can additionally choose (1) to impose an upper limit for the yield stress.
//   (4) Pressure dependent yield strength following Collins et al. (2004) and the implementation in Jutzi (2015)
//       -> yield strength is different for damaged (Y_d) and intact material (Y_i), and averaged mean (Y) in between:
//              Y_i = cohesion + \mu P / (1 + \mu P / (yield_stress - cohesion) )

//          \mu is the coefficient of internal friction (= tan(friction_angle))
//              Y_d = cohesion_damaged + \mu_d \times P

//              Y = (1-damage)*Y_i + damage*Y_d
//              Y is limited to <= Y_i
//       Note: If FRAGMENTATION is not activated only Y_i is used.
//       If you want to additionally model the influence of some (single) melt energy on the yield strength, then activate
//       COLLINS_PLASTICITY_INCLUDE_MELT_ENERGY, which adds a factor (1-e/e_melt) to the yield strength.

//   (5) Simplified version of the Collins et al. (2004) model, which uses only the

//       Unlike in (4), Y decreases to zero (following the Y_i function) for p<0.
