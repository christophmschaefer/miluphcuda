Impact simulation to compare with Nakamura & Fujiwara (1991) impact experiment.
See Sect. 4.4 in https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/06/aa28060-15/aa28060-15.html for details.

This example makes use of the Grady & Kipp tensile damage model.


How to run it:

(i)   execute create_input.sh in directory test_cases/nakamura/input
(ii)  compile miluphcuda with the parameter.h file from the test_cases/nakamura directory
(iii) copy input/impact.0000 to test_cases/nakamura and execute run.sh
(iv)  get a large coffee and wait

The simulation typically runs for several hours and produces 250 output files (500 MB each).


How to visualize results with Paraview:

(i)  create a paraview.xdmf file with utils/postprocessing/create_xdmf.py (run without arguments)
(ii) start Paraview, load the state file nakamura.pvsm, and from there paraview.xdmf
     (note: if your Paraview version is not compatible with the state file version (check the first few lines
     of nakamura.pvsm), either try a closer Paraview version, or load paraview.xdmf directly from Paraview)
