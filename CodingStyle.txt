Coding Style for miluphCUDA
---------------------------

last updated: Feb 2016

I personally think, that the most advanced CodingStyle for C is the Linux Kernel Coding Style written by Linus Torvalds
(see e.g. [1]) and is based on the old Kernighan and Ritchie Coding Style from the Bible of C. Linus' suggestion has
just one major flaw that makes it useless for scientific computing: He proposes an indentation level of 8 spaces.
That's too much. Really. Don't argue!  That's why we use an indentation level of 4 in the miluphCUDA code. If you use
the vim editor, please use following settings in your .vimrc file:

set textwidth=120
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
set softtabstop=4
set colorscheme=industry

If you do not need vim settings because your default editor is not vim, I'd strongly suggest to
change your default editor :^)


Thanks!
